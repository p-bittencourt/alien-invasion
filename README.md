# Alien Invasion

Developed following the guide from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/

Alien Invasion is a classic arcade-style game developed using the Pygame library. This project helped me practice Python programming, object-oriented programming, game development, and programming logic.

## Features

- **Player Control**: Move the spaceship using arrow keys and shoot bullets to destroy aliens.
- **Alien Waves**: Aliens descend in waves, increasing in difficulty as the game progresses.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as you destroy aliens.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when an alien collides with the spaceship or reaches the bottom of the screen.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alien-invasion.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd alien-invasion
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Play

1. Run the game:

```bash
python alien_invasion.py
```

2. Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship left and right.
3. Press the spacebar to shoot bullets at the aliens.
4. Avoid collisions with aliens and prevent them from reaching the bottom of the screen.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Python Programming**: Enhanced my understanding of Python syntax and concepts.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Applied OOP principles to structure the game components.
- **Game Development**: Gained experience in developing a game using the Pygame library.
- **Programming Logic**: Improved my problem-solving skills and logical thinking.

## Acknowledgements

- Thanks to the Pygame community for their excellent documentation and tutorials.

Enjoy the game!
